				Ventura is an elite group of people. We are aggressive, with a fascination for creative design. We do not encourage, but we exemplify chaos, the future, and above all, talent. a fidgety, fluctuating talent, almost like we live in the world with the impression that everything is a video game. We are collaborators from disparate faculties with starkly differing skills. We come together because we are all inspired to learn from each other while working on a project that has a quantifiable impact on the real world, within the industry it belongs to.
